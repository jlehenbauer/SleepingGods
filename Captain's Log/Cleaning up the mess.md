The crew was left in pretty bad shape after [[Beach exploring]], try to heal and rest up. 

Visited the auction house at [[58]] to buy and got an artifact and the Mixed Salad! Visited [[58]] again and sold our artifact for 6 coin. Narrowly escaped a bout of illness. Visit the inn with our coin and finally rest everyone up.

Went to [[107]] and helped Lula and Lyla with their broken flying machine, gaining a lot of materials. 

We moved on to [[77]] and captured a flock of seagulls who were guarding a cave, hiding a Super Sand Squid inside! After a brilliant battle, concluded by Gregory shooting his blow darts into the final flailing arm of the Squid, the crew finds the #totem [[Book of Fame and Infame]]! This, along with coin and a lot of #xp.

Using the coin, the crew travel to [[132]], where they use the [[Password]] to enter the auction, and at the highest bid (of 10 coins) to gain the  [[The Right Toe of Vilard]] and quest 19, [[Auction]].

ATTACKED BY THE MYTHANS.

We first ask why they don't want the god to awaken, they respond because they are free while the god is asleep.

ATTACK.

After a well-synergized battle, the Mythans are all toast. New event deck!

Travel back to #Glance to spend #xp ! 

While there, delivered the [[Letter]] to a warrior, [[Zvarm]] who comes with us! Gained [[Dagger]]. Stopped by the clock tower as well and met the mayor. We asked if he needs help and he asks us to obtain a shormeblood crystal, and directs us to the mine at [[69]], or to the artist at [[42]], who may have some. Gain quest 85 [[Crystal]].
