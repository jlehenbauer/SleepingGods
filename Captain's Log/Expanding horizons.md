Objective: Make a plan

The giant rats of [[63]] had wiped us out. We were in desperate need of supplies, so visited a market near [[20]], we found we were too low on funds to procure decent weapons, and made this our next goal. 

We set off back for the safety of #Zikura after exploring [[43]] and [[54]], where we rested and restored our crew. We decided to set off to the west and discovered a volcanic island with some helpful nomads. They gave us some clues that appear to lead north and west, but we decided to take a trip between the volcanic islands first, after some fortunate shipwrangling by Michael, deftly avoiding the perilous rocks. 

Here we found our first two major windfalls - a cache of supplies left in an abandoned [[Basement]] and a skeleton at [[29]] who was willing to make the most lucrative trades. 

Now stocked and with a full purse, we decide where to set off in search of armament to ensure we're prepared for whatever lies ahead...
