**Objective:** Begin again
**Sustenance**: Emerald Tavern Fare

Begin at [[2]] again and take the first action to move southeast. Explore [[44]] and try to extort the captain of the RMS Achean, Captain Meldrum. They steal three #totem and head east! Gain quest [[Luxury]] and [[Sapphire]].

Track the ship to [[48]] and take back our totems along with some coin and supplies. We leave the Achaean crew to their fate in the forest.

Visit the Market and collect a haul:
- Blow Darts
- Pot Roast
- Mixed Salad

Visit [[21]] and encounter a GIANT RED CENTIPEDE.  And a pale anaconda.... We defeat them both handly and gain a few coin, meat and XP.

Travel to [[Pig Ribs]] at [[150]] to heal up, etc. We visit the saloon and hear a story, gain [[Thunder]]. Visit the assay office and gain [[Mine]]. 

We follow the [[Thunder]] quest to [[35]]: we travel through the lightning and thunder and discover a staircase into a cave. We go into the cave instead of continuing up the path. We discover an entire ruined city complete with bodies and a tree in a ruined building and encounter a Root Demon and Silver Kryvern. PEDE.PEDE.PEDE.PEDE.PEDE.PEDE.PEDE.PEDE.

Defeated both with a FUCKING SAVAGE slay from Gregory stacked with synergies, driving his knife into the Root Demon's heart. A ragged ghost-woman speaks with Mac to ask what happens; they plotted to overthrow the gods, but the gods destroyed their city. We offer to help complete her quest, and [[Vyme the Pann Ghost]] joins us on our quest. Gain [[Guide]] from Vynne, which points us to the [[City of Ashes]]. 

Visit [[Pig Ribs]] port again to heal up and #levelup Kannan with Crack Shot. 

We move to the mine and visit [[45]]. With [[Mine]], we find miners who we defend from a Cinder Cave Gulg and a Cinder Cave Chanter. We defeat them with a final shot from the captain's rifle, and just barely get away. We meet Gum, who tells us about the imps - we take the "ore" and head back for [[Pig Ribs]] to return to the assay office. We're rewarded with lots of coin and some materials. Bought the Alzarian Cook Book  and the Pann bow. 

Travel all the way to [[City of Ashes]] to explore [[40]] at the behest of [[Vyme the Pann Ghost]]. Gain [[Letter]]. Follow [[Vyme the Pann Ghost]] into the destroyed city. We strength open a door, and she opens another set of doors with singing. We search through the boxes to find her lost weapons - a mechanical frog. [[Vyme the Pann Ghost]] says we can use this with 8 totems, and also leaves us a #totem! We gain the [[Stone of Storms]].

Finally, use the port at the [[City of Ashes]] to heal up and #levelup Rafael with Brawling!
