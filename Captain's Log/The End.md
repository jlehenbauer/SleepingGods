**Objective:** FINISH THEM
**Sustenance**: Cheeseburger Cunchwraps (TM) 

Run into a hurricane (last event card!) and get *fucked* and take a lot of ship damage. High-tail it back to #Aurora [[160]] (thanks to Audrie's Jury-Rigged Engine #levelup ) and heal up the ship and ourselves.

#levelup Kasumi's Counter ability for 3 #xp before the big move.

Ohmulde appears to warn us: the Hectakron is coming back. Always, and in force. 

We rally an overwhelming offense, eliminating all damage and status modifiers in the first strike of battle. One more round, and it's all over - we've done it. We've defeated the Hectakron again. 

We see an island with a tower and, as we climb, people chase us up the stairs, begging us not to wake the gods. 

We run.

All the way up. But as we do, Laurent falls, two arrows through him. The rest of us reach the top of the stairs and find the gods - 7 sleeping and one empty bed. We place our four totems on four beds, and they glow, flare, burn up, and fizzle out.

There's nothing else to be done.

We run the Manticore aground running from the Hectakron. Those of us that survive resign ourselves to an island, making the most of our days in this new land.

Earned ending 12.
