After a long and much-needed training session, the troupe was ready to set sail upon the open waters. 

After travelling around the island they noticed when when first arrived and spending some time at #Zikura port ([[130]]), we ventured to a [[Cottage]] where they (regrettably) beat up an old woman to obtain a map that directed us to a [[Raid]]. Before assisting the citizens we made shore on a small island with a [[Freighter]], where we discovered remnants of ourselves... this world is certainly not like ours, and not the only one at that.

When we finally arrived at [[63]], the rats were HUGE. In our first major conflict, we were able to make it out, but only just. We desperately need some new weapons. 

We need a rest to prepare for next time...
