Michael and Jacob explored [[12]] and got attacked by a three-eyed Titan - we ran away and picked up some materials on the way out, as well as the [[Fiery Salamander]].

We then ventured up to [[115]] where we saw and [[Airship]] go down, survivors may be found at [[103]]. 

Cole and Justin joined, and began our journey toward #Lukra around the south of the volcanic island.

We followed an island floating in the air at [[92]], but couldn't keep up with it.

We made it to #Lukra!!
