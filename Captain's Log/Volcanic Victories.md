**Objective:** Make it to #Lukra , get some weapons

Michael and Jacob explored [[12]] and got attacked by a three-eyed Titan - we ran away and picked up some materials on the way out, as well as the [[Fiery Salamander]].

We then ventured up to [[115]] where we saw and [[Airship]] go down, survivors may be found at [[103]]. 

Cole and Justin joined, and began our journey toward #Lukra around the south of the volcanic island.

We followed an island floating in the air at [[92]], but couldn't keep up with it.

We made it to #Lukra!!  Rested the crew and #levelup Captain Odessa with Endurance!

Depleted the event deck, encountered the [[Hectakron]] and readied for #battle.

Captain Odessa used Mac and Kasumi's synergies to deliver the death blow to the [[Hectakron]] head after a hard-fought battle with the crew. 

We went to the market and readied ourselves with much-needed weapons before heading into #Lukra  city [[70]].  We visited the university and collected the [[Science]] quest that seems to direct to [[87]]. We explored the merchant district before leaving and met a man who would sell us the #divingsuit, but we need to #revisit as we don't have the coin after purchasing weapons at the market. 

We visited the eastern part of the city [[41]] and found Jin!! Someone poisoned her though, and we need to collect a crystal from the Hive tower; we climb up and are attacked by three eyeballs...

We succeed! We find the crystal, but it has a totem in it! We got [[Ohmlude's Crystal]] - but it means we need another way to heal Jin. We completed [[Cook]] in the process, and gained [[Poison]]. 

To recoup, we visited the port again and healed up and #levelup
