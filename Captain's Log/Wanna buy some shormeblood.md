**Objective:** Figure out about this shormeblood crystal
**Sustenance**: TB 12 pack & Diet Coke

Healed up a little before heading to find some shormeblood crystal at [[69]].

Deal with an infestation of giant crows and ALMOST FUCKIN DIE. We leave with only two total health among the group, with Marco succumbing to his venom before we make it back to the port. As a result though, we collect many resources and #xp, as well as the shormeblood we need for the mayor of #Glance. Complete [[Crystal]] and gain [[Materials]]. 

Take a few turns to spend all the coin at the inn to heal and restore fatigue. Spend #xp on Laurent's Watchful ability and Gregory's Patch Up ability. Also visit the auction house to purchase meat and veggies. 

Then take the shormeblood to the mayor and in return, get the #totem [[Stone of Bargaining]]! Completed [[Materials]], gain [[Clock]]. 

Head up to #Porthaven and find a city of monsters. We decide to talk rather than attack, and the leader, Wayfinder, invites us over. Before heading to him, we head to the market and nab a vest with three block and a new recipe (four of any food for four fatigue and 5 health!) for real cheap using our new [[Stone of Bargaining]]. 

We go talk to Wayfinder, who tells us that the powers the gods hold are immortal, but the gods themselves can be stripped of their powers and made mortal. He agrees to accompany us if we aid him in removing the powers from the gods once we awaken them. He directs us toward three (!!!!!) #totem by giving us [[Rich]], [[Tower]], and [[Shift]].
